# HID Scripts  
Some simple HID scripts for use in keystroke injection attacks with the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. Two of the scripts require storing the desired data to the P4wnP1 itself, designated as USB Mass Storage device E:/ in the script. Be sure to update that to the necessary drive letter and configure the P4wnP1 for Mass Storage by disabling Mouse emulation and enabling USB Mass Storage emulation and choosing the necessary .bin file in the USB settings.
